"""Pure decision logic for the Crewrift Prime skill gate.

NO I/O. This module is the single source of truth for:
  - tunable thresholds (env-overridable constants),
  - how each skill metric is computed from per-slot ``game_results`` arrays,
  - the per-skill verdicts and the strict three-skill AND gate,
  - the human-readable reason string and the structured ``DecisionRecord``.

Both the hosted commissioner (crewrift_prime_skill_commissioner.py) and the
local debug script (debug_decision.py) call ``evaluate_entrant`` /
``evaluate_entrants`` so they emit IDENTICAL decision records.

# Thresholds are intentionally "easier for now" (lowered 2026-06-24) so a modest
# policy can clear the gate while each drill still measures real skill (none are
# trivially 0). Observed crewborg-aaln drill metrics historically: voting ~0.0,
# hunting ~0.75 kills, tasks ~10.5. All three remain env-overridable, and MUST

# VOTING is a PARTICIPATION / CAPABILITY ASSURANCE (redesigned 2026-06-24), NOT a

# Honest meeting-aware gate (2026-06-24): a drill episode only offers a vote if a
# MEETING actually occurs (a player reports a body or presses the emergency
# button). If NO meeting occurs in the whole drill (no votes/skips/timeouts on any
# seat) the entrant was never GIVEN THE CHANCE to vote, so we do NOT penalize it
# (no-opportunity -> pass). When meetings DO occur, the entrant passes by casting
# at least one vote/skip (or speaking); it fails only if it had meetings yet never
# voted/talked. With CREWRIFT_PRIME_MEETING_PARTICIPATION_MIN > 0 the bar tightens
# to "participate in >= that fraction of the meetings"; default 0.0 = "any vote
