"""Crewrift Prime qualifier commissioner — event-driven, results-JSON gate.

A subclass of the stock config-driven ``RulesetStrategyCommissioner`` that owns an
EVENT-DRIVEN qualification loop end to end. There is NO "Qualifiers" staging
division any more: when a new policy is submitted to the league, the commissioner
itself (1) creates and runs an EXPERIENCE REQUEST (xp request) self-play episode
for it, (2) reads the episode's per-slot RESULTS JSON artifact to derive the skill
metrics, (3) evaluates the strict three-skill gate, and (4) on pass promotes the
policy DIRECTLY into the Competition division (on fail, holds for retry or DQs).

Why a custom image is required
------------------------------
The stock ruleset_strategy commissioner's transition vocabulary
(``TransitionCriteriaConfig``, ``extra="forbid"``) only allows
``completed_episodes_*`` / ``score_*`` and discards every other field of the
per-slot ``results_schema``. To gate on advanced skills we must read the game's
results ourselves -> new image. We go further: we own the xp-request client
(``xp_request_client.py``) so the "submit -> run xp request -> read results JSON
-> promote" loop lives entirely in the commissioner. The qualifier reads the
game's own end-of-episode ``results`` artifact (the seat-indexed
``results_schema`` the platform stores per job at ``/jobs/{job_id}/artifacts/results``)
— the SAME shape the Competition path already consumes from
``EpisodeResult.game_results`` — so no replay download or Nim re-expansion is
needed. The Competition division and its win-count scoring are reused.

The submission seam (no per-submission protocol message exists)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The stock platform<->commissioner protocol is round-driven (round_start /
episode_result / schedule_rounds / league_migration / rank_division /
describe_division). It carries NO "policy submitted" message. The most
appropriate existing seam that (a) sees every membership with its status and
(b) returns ``policy_membership_events`` is ``migrate_league``. We override it so
each ``submitted``/``qualifying`` membership is run through the qualification loop
(:meth:`qualify_submission`) and promoted/held/DQ'd. See README for the platform
note: it must call ``migrate_league`` (or an equivalent submission hook) when a
new policy is submitted, since the stock protocol exposes no per-submission event.

The gate ("one xp-request game and we're in")
---------------------------------------------
Each submitted policy plays ONE 8-seat *self-play* combined game via an xp
request. Self-play fills all 8 seats with the entrant, so the single game
exercises every role and all three signals come from the episode results JSON's
per-slot metrics:

- VOTING  = ``meeting_participation`` — capability/participation, not correctness.
- HUNTING = ``imposter_kills`` — total kills landed by the imposter seat(s).
- TASKS   = ``crew_tasks_mean`` — mean tasks completed across the crew seats.

Pass ALL three -> Competition (competing/champion). Fail any -> hold (status
qualifying) and re-run next time. Crash/infra safety: a completed episode with a
populated results JSON is not a crash; a genuine non-completion DQs; xp-request
infra failures and missing/unfetchable results JSON HOLD-retry (never DQ) — there
is no qualifier division to hold IN, so the hold keeps the membership
``qualifying`` in place.

Competition scoring: 1 point per winning PLAYER (seat), by role (unchanged).

Observability (see decision.py for the pure decision function)
--------------------------------------------------------------
For every entrant we build a ``DecisionRecord`` and log one
``COMMISSIONER_DECISION {json}`` line to stdout plus rich membership-event
evidence, identical to before.

Thresholds are constants (env-overridable) in decision.py.
