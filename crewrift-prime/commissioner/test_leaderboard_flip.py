"""Regression guard for the leaderboard-score-flip bug.

The Competition board kept flip-flopping because two platform writers persisted
two DIFFERENT boards to ``division.leaderboard_config``: the scheduling tick's
``rank_division`` and every round completion (whose ``RoundComplete`` lacked a
``leaderboards`` payload, so the platform's compatibility shim fabricated its own
board from the per-round ``results`` and overwrote the commissioner's).

The fix makes ``_complete_competition_round`` publish the SAME win-rate board
``rank_division`` computes, by aggregating the division's per-round win history
(carried in commissioner ``state``) through the shared ``_win_total_board``.
These tests assert round-complete publishes that win-rate board, that it equals
what ``rank_division`` produces over the same history, and that the history
accumulation is idempotent on a retried round-complete.
