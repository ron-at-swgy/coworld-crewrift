"""Leaderboard ``score`` = floored cumulative sum of per-round scores.

The displayed leaderboard ``score`` column is now the ABSOLUTE CUMULATIVE SUM of
a player's per-round scores across ALL completed rounds, floored at 0 (never
negative) — NOT the prior 6h-half-life EWMA (non-competition) nor the win RATE
(competition). The win-rate metric and the win-rate RANKING for the Competition
division are unchanged: only the value placed in ``score`` differs.

These tests assert, for BOTH publishing paths:

* Competition (``CrewriftPrimeSkillCommissioner.rank_division`` over a competition
  division) publishes ``score = max(0, sum of per-round win scores)``, that the
  RANKING still follows descending win rate (so the cumulative score does NOT
  change the order), and that a raw-negative total floors to 0.
* The stock/non-competition path (``rank_division`` deferring to
  ``BaselineCommissioner``) emits the same floored cumulative sum.
