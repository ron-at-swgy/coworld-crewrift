# Reward v1

Reward v1 is a small text websocket protocol for streaming per-player reward
data from a Bitworld simulation.

The client connects to a websocket endpoint. The usual path is:

```text
/reward
```

The protocol uses text websocket messages. The server sends one text message for
every simulation tick.

## Packet Format

Each message is a newline separated packet. Each non-empty line starts with a
name of the key, followed by a player identity and value:

```text
reward player1 200
```

The packet format is ASCII compatible UTF-8 text. Lines end with `\n`. A sender
may use `\r\n`. A receiver should ignore empty lines.

## Line Format

```text
<name> <player> <value>
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | `string` | Name of the value |
| Player | `string` | Player identity |
| Value | `integer` | Value for this player |

`Player` is one field and must not contain spaces. A player may provide it when
connecting to the player websocket with `?name=player1`. If no name is provided,
the server may use a network identity such as `127.0.0.1:54002`. `Value` is
written as a base 10 integer.

The current required name is:

| Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `reward` | Reward used for training |

The server must send one `reward` line for each player in each tick packet.

Servers may also emit per-player stat lines using the same line format.
A receiver should treat any unknown name as opaque and ignore it. The
following names are currently emitted by Crewrift and are stable:

| Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `wins_imposter` | Lifetime games won as impostor |
| `wins_crewmate` | Lifetime games won as crewmate |
| `games_imposter` | Lifetime games started as impostor |
| `games_crewmate` | Lifetime games started as crewmate |
| `kills` | Lifetime kills (impostor) |
| `tasks` | Lifetime task completions |
| `vote_players` | Lifetime votes cast for a player |
| `vote_skip` | Lifetime explicit skip votes |
| `vote_timeout` | Lifetime vote timeouts |

Stat values are cumulative for the lifetime of one player identity on the
server. They reset only when the server restarts (current Crewrift
behavior; future implementations may persist them).

## Multiple Players

A packet may contain reward data for multiple players. Each line identifies the
player that the value belongs to.

```text
reward 127.0.0.1:54002 200
reward 127.0.0.1:54003 -25
```

The same packet should not contain two lines with the same name and player. If
it does, the last line should replace earlier lines for that name and player.

## Future Values

Future versions may add more names. Useful examples include:

```text
reward 127.0.0.1:54002 200
advantage 127.0.0.1:54002 40
steps 127.0.0.1:54002 12
```

A receiver must read `reward` values. A receiver should ignore names it does not
understand.

## Message Rules

A server-to-client text message is one reward packet for one simulation tick.

The server should send packets in simulation tick order. If no players are
connected, the server may send an empty packet or skip the tick.

Client-to-server messages are not used by this protocol.

Binary websocket messages are invalid in this version.
