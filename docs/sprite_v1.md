# Sprite v1

Sprite v1 is a small binary protocol for sprite based displays. The
server sends sprite definitions and object placements. The client sends keyboard
and mouse input.

Sprite v1 connects over WebSocket. The endpoint is a full websocket URL,
such as `ws://localhost:8080/global`.

The protocol is designed to be simple to parse. Every message starts with a
single message type byte, followed by a fixed set of little endian fields. Any
payload with variable length has its length encoded before the payload bytes.

Sprites and objects are shared across layers. An object is either absent or it
belongs to exactly one layer. Each layer has its own viewport.

## Integer Encoding

All integer fields are unsigned unless stated otherwise.

| Type | Size | Encoding |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `u8` | 1 byte | Raw byte |
| `u16` | 2 bytes | Little endian |
| `i16` | 2 bytes | Little endian twos complement |
| `u32` | 4 bytes | Little endian |

Coordinates use `i16` so objects and pointer positions can be placed outside
the visible viewport.

## Server to Client Messages

### Define Sprite

Defines or replaces a sprite.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x01` |
| Sprite id | `u16` | Id of the sprite to define |
| Width | `u16` | Sprite width in pixels |
| Height | `u16` | Sprite height in pixels |
| Compressed length | `u32` | Number of compressed pixel bytes |
| Compressed pixels | `u8[]` | Snappy compressed raw RGBA pixels |
| Label length | `u16` | Number of UTF-8 label bytes |
| Label | `u8[]` | Optional human-readable sprite label |

The compressed pixel payload must be a Snappy stream. After decompression, the
payload must be exactly `Width * Height * 4` bytes. Each pixel is four bytes in
RGBA order: red, green, blue, alpha. Color channels are unpremultiplied
`0 .. 255` values. An alpha value of `0` is fully transparent. An alpha value
of `255` is fully opaque.

If a sprite id already exists, the client must replace the old sprite data with
the new definition. The label replaces the old label for that sprite id. A
label length of `0` means the sprite has no label. Labels are for tooling,
debugging, and human inspection. They do not affect rendering.

A sprite with width `0` or height `0` is invalid.

### Define Object

Defines or replaces an object instance.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x02` |
| Object id | `u16` | Id of the object to define |
| X | `i16` | Object x position |
| Y | `i16` | Object y position |
| Z | `i16` | Object draw order |
| Layer | `u8` | Layer containing the object |
| Sprite id | `u16` | Sprite used by the object |

If an object id already exists, the client must replace the old object state
with the new state and move it to the given layer. If the sprite id has not been
defined yet, the client should keep the object but draw nothing until the sprite
is defined.

### Delete Object

Removes an object instance.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x03` |
| Object id | `u16` | Id of the object to delete |

Deleting an unknown object id is a no-op.

### Clear Objects

Removes all object instances.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x04` |

Sprite definitions remain loaded.

### Set Viewport

Sets the viewport size for one layer.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x05` |
| Layer | `u8` | Layer to resize |
| Width | `u16` | Viewport width in pixels |
| Height | `u16` | Viewport height in pixels |

Each layer viewport starts at `(0, 0)` and ends before `(Width, Height)`. A
viewport with width `0` or height `0` is invalid.

### Define Layer

Defines a layer kind and flags.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x06` |
| Layer | `u8` | Layer id |
| Type | `u8` | Layer type |
| Flags | `u8` | Layer flags |

Layer type values:

| Value | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0x00` | Map zoomable layer |
| `0x01` | Top left UI layer |
| `0x02` | Top right UI layer |
| `0x03` | Bottom right UI layer |
| `0x04` | Bottom left UI layer |
| `0x05` | Center top UI layer |
| `0x06` | Center right UI layer |
| `0x07` | Center left UI layer |
| `0x08` | Center bottom UI layer |

Layer flag values:

| Value | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0x01` | Zoomable layer |
| `0x02` | UI layer |

The map layer should use type `0x00` and flag `0x01`. UI layers should use one
of the UI layer types and flag `0x02`. Unknown layers are invalid. Redefining a
layer replaces its type and flags but does not delete objects in that layer.

## Client to Server Messages

### Input Text

Sends one or more ASCII input bytes from the client.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x81` |
| Length | `u16` | Number of ASCII bytes |
| Bytes | `u8[]` | ASCII bytes |

The client may send as many ASCII letters as it wants by using multiple input
text messages. Bytes in the printable ASCII range `0x20 .. 0x7e` represent typed
characters.

Bytes in the lower ASCII range `0x00 .. 0x1f` are reserved for control input.
The current control codes are:

| Code | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0x08` | Backspace |
| `0x09` | Tab |
| `0x0a` | Enter |
| `0x1b` | Escape |

Other lower ASCII codes are reserved for future keyboard, modifier, and mouse
button meanings.

### Mouse Position

Sends the current mouse position.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x82` |
| X | `i16` | Mouse x position |
| Y | `i16` | Mouse y position |
| Layer | `u8` | Layer containing the mouse position |

For the map layer, the coordinate system is the same as object coordinates. For
UI layers, `X` and `Y` are local to that UI layer viewport.

The client should send the topmost UI layer under the pointer when the pointer
is over UI. Otherwise, it should send the map layer.

### Mouse Button

Sends a mouse button event using a lower ASCII control code.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x83` |
| Code | `u8` | Lower ASCII control code |
| Down | `u8` | `0` for up, `1` for down |

Suggested mouse button control codes:

| Code | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0x01` | Left mouse button |
| `0x02` | Right mouse button |
| `0x03` | Middle mouse button |

### Player Input

Sends the current held player button state. This packet is intended for
sprite-based player endpoints such as `/player`, where the server renders the
game through this protocol and accepts the standard player controls.

Player endpoints may accept the same join query parameters as `/player`:
`name`, `slot`, and `token`. `slot` is zero-based and lets the server assign a
stable player position. `token` may be used for simple slot auth.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message type | `u8` | `0x84` |
| Buttons | `u8` | Current held player button bitmask |

Button bit values match Bitscreen v1:

| Bit | Value | Meaning |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| `0` | `0x01` | D-pad up |
| `1` | `0x02` | D-pad down |
| `2` | `0x04` | D-pad left |
| `3` | `0x08` | D-pad right |
| `4` | `0x10` | Select |
| `5` | `0x20` | A |
| `6` | `0x40` | B |

The client should send this packet whenever the held button bitmask changes.
The server should treat omitted bits as released. Bit `7` is reserved and must
be sent as `0`.

Clients that support typing should keep keyboard gameplay input separate from
text input. While the client is in text entry mode, printable keys should update
the local text buffer instead of changing the player input bitmask. When the
text is submitted, the client should send the existing Input Text packet.

## Message Type Summary

| Value | Direction | Message |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `0x01` | Server to client | Define sprite |
| `0x02` | Server to client | Define object |
| `0x03` | Server to client | Delete object |
| `0x04` | Server to client | Clear objects |
| `0x05` | Server to client | Set viewport |
| `0x06` | Server to client | Define layer |
| `0x81` | Client to server | Input text |
| `0x82` | Client to server | Mouse position |
| `0x83` | Client to server | Mouse button |
| `0x84` | Client to server | Player input |

Message values `0x00`, `0x07 .. 0x7f`, and `0x85 .. 0xff` are reserved.

## Rendering Model

The client keeps three tables:

| State | Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layers | `u8 layer id` | Type, flags, viewport width, and viewport height |
| Sprites | `u16 sprite id` | Width, height, label, and RGBA pixel buffer |
| Objects | `u16 object id` | X, y, z, layer, and sprite id |

The client draws all visible layers. Within a layer, objects use their current
sprite. Objects with lower `z` values are drawn first. If two objects have the
same `z`, the object with the lower `y` value is drawn first. If two objects
have the same `z` and `y`, the object with the lower object id is drawn first.

Objects outside their layer viewport are clipped. Pixels with layer coordinates
less than `0`, greater than or equal to the layer viewport width, or greater
than or equal to the layer viewport height are not drawn.

The map zoomable layer is drawn in world coordinates and may be zoomed and
panned by the client. UI layers are drawn in screen coordinates after the map
layer. UI layer placement is selected by its layer type. For example, the top
left layer is anchored to the top left of the screen and the center bottom layer
is horizontally centered and anchored to the bottom of the screen.

Sprite pixels with alpha `0` should be treated as transparent. Sprite pixels
with alpha greater than `0` should be composited over lower objects in draw
order. Clients may use straight alpha compositing or simply overwrite
destination pixels for fully opaque sprites.

## Error Handling

A receiver should close the connection on malformed messages, including:

- Unknown message types.
- Truncated messages.
- Sprite compressed payloads that fail Snappy decompression.
- Sprite decompressed pixel payloads that do not match `Width * Height * 4`.
- Sprite labels whose byte count does not match `Label length`.
- Sprite dimensions whose product cannot fit in local memory.
- Objects that reference unknown layers.
- Viewports with width `0` or height `0`.
- Layer types outside `0x00 .. 0x08`.
- Boolean fields with values other than `0` or `1`.

Unknown object ids in delete messages are not errors.

## Example

This byte sequence defines sprite `7` as a `2x2` sprite labeled `test`, with
four RGBA pixels: opaque red, opaque green, opaque blue, and transparent black.
The compressed pixel payload is a Snappy stream that decompresses to the four
RGBA pixels.

```text
01 07 00 02 00 02 00 12 00 00 00
10 3c ff 00 00 ff 00 ff 00 ff
00 00 ff ff 00 00 00 00
04 00 74 65 73 74
```

Decoded fields:

| Bytes | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `01` | Define sprite |
| `07 00` | Sprite id `7` |
| `02 00` | Width `2` |
| `02 00` | Height `2` |
| `12 00 00 00` | Compressed pixel byte length `18` |
| `10 3c ... 00` | Snappy compressed RGBA payload |
| `04 00` | Label length `4` |
| `74 65 73 74` | Label `test` |

This byte sequence places object `3` at `x = 10`, `y = 20`, `z = 0`, layer
`0`, using sprite `7`:

```text
02 03 00 0a 00 14 00 00 00 00 07 00
```
